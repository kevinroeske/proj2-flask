Flask Web Server

Listens for a login, and sends a dynamically generated web document built from an HTML template, a .css configuration file,
and formatted text as data (FLASK framework). In this case, it's the class syllabus. On the server side, the app checks the current 
date, calculates which week is the current week, and a script (jinji, in flask) in the template uses that to highlight the background 
on the line for the current week.
